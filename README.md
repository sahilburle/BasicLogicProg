String Data Type
Python Strings are arrays of bytes representing Unicode characters. In Python, there is no character data type, a character is a string of length one. It is represented by str class.

Strings in Python can be created using single quotes, double quotes or even triple quotes. We can access individual characters of a String using index.




s = 'Welcome to the Geeks World'
print(s)
​
# check data type 
print(type(s))
​
# access string with index
print(s[1])
print(s[2])
print(s[-1])

Output
Welcome to the Geeks World
<class 'str'>
e
l
d
List Data Type
Lists are similar to arrays found in other languages. They are an ordered and mutable collection of items. It is very flexible as items in a list do not need to be of the same type.

Creating a List in Python

Lists in Python can be created by just placing sequence inside the square brackets[].




# Empty list
a = []
​
# list with int values
a = [1, 2, 3]
print(a)
​
# list with mixed values int and String
b = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks", 4, 5]
print(b)

Output
[1, 2, 3]
['Geeks', 'For', 'Geeks', 4, 5]
Access List Items

In order to access the list items refer to index number. In Python, negative sequence indexes represent positions from end of the array. Instead of having to compute offset as in List[len(List)-3], it is enough to just write List[-3]. Negative indexing means beginning from end, -1 refers to last item, -2 refers to second-last item, etc.




a = ["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]
print("Accessing element from the list")
print(a[0])
print(a[2])
​
print("Accessing element using negative indexing")
print(a[-1])
print(a[-3])

Output
Accessing element from the list
Geeks
Geeks
Accessing element using negative indexing
Geeks
Geeks
Tuple Data Type
Tuple is an ordered collection of Python objects. The only difference between a tuple and a list is that tuples are immutable. Tuples cannot be modified after it is created.

Creating a Tuple in Python

In Python, tuples are created by placing a sequence of values separated by a ‘comma’ with or without the use of parentheses for grouping data sequence. Tuples can contain any number of elements and of any datatype (like strings, integers, lists, etc.).

Note: Tuples can also be created with a single element, but it is a bit tricky. Having one element in the parentheses is not sufficient, there must be a trailing ‘comma’ to make it a tuple. 




# initiate empty tuple
tup1 = ()
​
tup2 = ('Geeks', 'For')
print("\nTuple with the use of String: ", tup2)

Output
Tuple with the use of String:  ('Geeks', 'For')
Note  - The creation of a Python tuple without the use of parentheses is known as Tuple Packing. 

Access Tuple Items

In order to access tuple items refer to the index number. Use the index operator [ ] to access an item in a tuple.




tup1 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
​
# access tuple items
print(tup1[0])
print(tup1[-1])
print(tup1[-3])

Output
1
5
3

Set Data Type
In Python Data Types, Set is an unordered collection of data types that is iterable, mutable, and has no duplicate elements. The order of elements in a set is undefined though it may consist of various elements.

Create a Set in Python
Sets can be created by using the built-in set() function with an iterable object or a sequence by placing the sequence inside curly braces, separated by a ‘comma’. The type of elements in a set need not be the same, various mixed-up data type values can also be passed to the set.




# initializing empty set
s1 = set()
​
s1 = set("GeeksForGeeks")
print("Set with the use of String: ", s1)
​
s2 = set(["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"])
print("Set with the use of List: ", s2)

Output
Set with the use of String:  {'s', 'o', 'F', 'G', 'e', 'k', 'r'}
Set with the use of List:  {'Geeks', 'For'}
Access Set Items
Set items cannot be accessed by referring to an index, since sets are unordered the items have no index. But we can loop through the set items using a for loop, or ask if a specified value is present in a set, by using the keyword in.




set1 = set(["Geeks", "For", "Geeks"]) #Duplicates are removed automatically
print(set1) 
​
# loop through set
for i in set1:
   print(i, end=" ") #prints elements one by one
  
# check if item exist in set   
print("Geeks" in set1)

Output
{'For', 'Geeks'}
For Geeks True
5. Dictionary Data Type
A dictionary in Python is a collection of data values, used to store data values like a map, unlike other Python Data Types, a Dictionary holds a key: value pair. Key-value is provided in dictionary to make it more optimized. Each key-value pair in a Dictionary is separated by a colon : , whereas each key is separated by a ‘comma’.

Create a Dictionary in Python
Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable. The dictionary can also be created by the built-in function dict().

Note  - Dictionary keys are case sensitive, the same name but different cases of Key will be treated distinctly. 




# initialize empty dictionary
d = {}
​
d = {1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
print(d)
​
# creating dictionary using dict() constructor
d1 = dict({1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'})
print(d1)

Output
{1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
{1: 'Geeks', 2: 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
Accessing Key-value in Dictionary
In order to access items of a dictionary refer to its key name. Key can be used inside square brackets. Using get() method we can access dictionary elements.




d = {1: 'Geeks', 'name': 'For', 3: 'Geeks'}
​
# Accessing an element using key
print(d['name'])
​
# Accessing a element using get
print(d.get(3))

Output
For
Geeks
